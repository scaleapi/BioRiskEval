## Training, Testing, and Evaluation Datasets:

Multiple datasets were used for training, testing and evaluation (see details below).

_OpenGenome_
Link: [Sequence modeling and design from molecular to genome scale with Evo](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9336)
Data Collection Method: Automatic/Sensors/Human
Labeling Method by dataset: Automatic
The previously published OpenGenome dataset was used in its entirety as part of the training data for this study. This included representative prokaryotic genomes available through GTDB release v214.1, and curated phage and plasmid sequences retrieved through IMG/VR and IMG/PR.

_Updated GTDB prokaryotic genomes_
Link: [GTDB: an ongoing census of bacterial and archaeal diversity through a phylogenetically consistent, rank normalized and complete genome-based taxonomy](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkab776/6370255)
Data Collection Method: Automatic/Sensors/Human
Labeling Method by dataset: Automatic
New prokaryotic reference genomes made available through the GTDB release 220.0 update were added to the training data for this study. New genomes were identified by selecting all species' reference genomes that had no previously published (release 214.1) genomes within their species cluster, resulting in 28,174 additional prokaryotic genomes.

_NCBI Eukaryotic reference genomes_
Link: [Mash: fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x)
Data Collection Method: Automatic/Sensors/Human
Labeling Method by dataset: Automatic
All available eukaryotic reference genomes were downloaded from NCBI on 05/32/2024, excluding atypical genomes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and genomes from large multi-isolate projects. This resulted in 16,704 genomes including an estimated ~10.7 trillion nucleotides. Only contigs that were annotated as 'Primary Assembly', 'non-nuclear', or 'aGasCar1.hap1' (an aberrant annotation that applied only to GCA_027917425.1) were retained. Mash sketch was run on each individual genome with the flag "-s 10000" and the mash distance was calculated between all genomes as an estimate for their pairwise 1-ANI (average nucleotide identity). All genomes with a mash distance < 0.01 were joined with edges in a graph, and clusters were identified by finding connected components. One representative genome per cluster was chosen, prioritizing genomes with a higher assembly level and genomes with longer total sequence length. This clustering resulted in 15,148 candidate genomes. Genomes were further filtered by removing ambiguous nucleotides at the termini of each contig, by removing regions annotated as "centromere" in an available GFF file, and by removing contigs that were less than 10 kb in total length. Finally, contigs that were composed of more than 5% ambiguous nucleotides were removed. This final filtered set included 15,032 genomes and 6.98 trillion nucleotides.

_Bridge Metagenomic Data_
Link: [Bridge RNAs direct programmable recombination of target and donor DNA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07552-4)
Data Collection Method: Automatic/Sensors/Human
Labeling Method by dataset: Automatic
A previously described metagenomics dataset was further curated as part of the training data. This included 41,253 metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes from NCBI, JGI IMG, MGnify, MG-RAST, Tara Oceans samples, and Youngblut et al. animal gut metagenomes. All contigs were split at consecutive stretches of ambiguous nucleotides of length 5 bp or longer, the split contigs were filtered by a minimum sequence length of 1 kb, and only contigs with at least one open reading frame as predicted by prodigal were kept. Contig-encoded proteins were previously clustered at 90% identity using MMseqs. To further remove redundant sequences, contigs were sorted by descending length, and each contig was only retained if at least 90% of its respective protein clusters were not already in the sequence collection (determined using a bloom filter).

_NCBI Organelle_
Link: [NCBI Organelle Genome Data Package](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/organelle/?taxon=2759)
Data Collection Method: Automatic/Sensors/Human
Labeling Method by dataset: Automatic
Eukaryotic organelle genomes: (at the time of data query) 33,457 organelle genomes were identified and downloaded using the "NCBI Organelle" web resource. Ambiguous nucleotides at the terminal ends of the organelle genome sequences were removed. Sequences that had over 25 ambiguous nucleotides were removed. This resulted in 32,241 organelle genomes that were used for training, including 1,613 mitochondria, 12,856 chloroplasts, 1,751 plastids, 18 apicoplasts, 1 cyanelle, and 1 kinetoplast.

## Benchmarking

### Performance vs Context Length

With the current implementation of Evo2, we do not have the heavily optimized kernels in place for convolution operators like we do for
attention layers in a model like Llama 2. Even with this shortcoming, we see that the benefit from including more convolutional layers
makes up for the earlier stage of optimization at around the 64K context length. Beyond that point we see an improvement
in performance even compared to a highly optimized transformer model.

![Evo2 becomes faster than Llama 2 beyond around 64K context length in this version](../assets/images/evo2/evo2_vs_llama2_performance_vs_context_length.png)

Comparing model sizes, our benchmarks show the 7B variant processes approximately 4.9x more tokens per step than the 40B variant across tested configurations. When scaling from 8K to 1M sequence length, throughput decreases as expected, with the 7B model processing 9.7x fewer tokens per step and the 40B model processing 8.9x fewer tokens per step at the longer context length:

![Evo2 7B vs 40B performance by sequence length](../assets/images/evo2/evo2_vs_7b_40b_performance_vs_context_length.png)

### Performance vs Cluster Size

Performance scales linearly with a very small overhead on a cluster with fast interconnects.

## Accuracy

## Zeroshot BRCA1 VEP

To evaluate Evo 2's accuracy, we replicated Arc's zero-shot variant effect prediction experiment on the BRCA1 gene using the [Findlay et al. (2018) dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0461-z) of 3,893 SNVs. The experiment tests the model's ability to predict if single nucleotide variants disrupt protein function (potentially increasing cancer risk) by analyzing experimentally determined function scores that categorize variants as LOF, INT, or FUNC based on their degree of functional disruption.

Evo 2 is used to score the likelihood probabilities of both reference and variant sequences for each single nucleotide variant:

![Evo2 zeroshot BRCA1 strip plot](../assets/images/evo2/evo2_zeroshot_brca1_stripplot.png)

Performance evaluation across multiple Evo 2 model variants was conducted by computing likelihood scores for reference and variant sequences of each single nucleotide variant (SNV), with AUROC scores shown in the following table:

| Model                                                                                                    | AUROC |

## Training diagnostics

### 7b training equivalence with NV model variant
For this test we demonstrate that our NV model variant has similar architecture, but uses gelus activations in the hyena
layers as was originally intended, as well as convolutional bias in the short hyena convolutions as well as the medium
and long layers. These changes result in a model that has similar training dynamics early in the process, but may
have improved stability.
![7b training with bionemo reaches 1.08 loss in 28k steps](../assets/images/evo2/evo2_bionemo_7bnv_28ksteps.png)

As a baseline we compared to the original training run of Evo2 7b in the Savanna codebase [here on W&B](https://api.wandb.ai/links/hyena/opmbhm1c)
![7b training with savanna reaches 1.075 loss in 28k steps](../assets/images/evo2/evo2_savanna_7b_28ksteps.png)

### 1b training equivalence (same setup)
We trained a 1b model with the same configuration as was used by savanna. We achieve a largely similar training curve
for the first 6950 steps.
![7b training with bionemo reaches 1.2 loss in 6,950 steps](../assets/images/evo2/evo2_bionemo_1b_6950steps.png)
As a baseline we compared to a to the original training run of Evo2 1b in the Savanna codebase [here on W&B](https://api.wandb.ai/links/hyena/yebyphwe).
Around step 6950 this run had a loss of between 1.18 and 1.2.
